terminfo
========

A terminfo database front end in Common Lisp.  Based on [terminfo](http://users.actrix.co.nz/mycroft/terminfo.lisp) by Paul Foley.

Terminfo was later modified for use in linedit and the hemlock text editor.  This library is an attempt to consolidate changes to the terminfo package to provide a flexible interface.
